# Hey there, I'm Sajjad Karimi! 👋

## Who Am I?
I'm a Laravel wizard with a knack for creating dynamic, scalable web apps. I love diving into code, learning from the community, and sprinkling a little magic on every project I tackle.

## What I Do
- **Backend Brilliance**: Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- **Frontend Flair**: Vue.js (keeping it modern and sleek)
- **Extras**: RESTful APIs, Git, PHPUnit, Pest

## My Mission
I’m on a journey to become a well-rounded Full-Stack Developer—one who not only writes clean, efficient code but also makes a positive impact on the open-source world. Collaboration and learning are at the heart of everything I do.

## Lifelong Learning
I'm always exploring new trends and tech, sharing insights with fellow developers, and pushing my skills further with every project. Whether it's a deep dive into advanced Laravel techniques or experimenting with the latest frameworks, there's never a dull moment.
